# **Asphalt Kings**
This game is a project I developed as part of the "Unity Learn Junior Programmer" program. It was created with the aim of improving my skills.
Additional features have been added to the project: switching between 4 different camera angles, enhanced environment design, and win and dead scenes.

## **How To Play**
### **Basic Features**
* Forward Movement and Steering: The player controls the car to move forward and steers it left or right to follow the path.
* Obstacles: The game features two types of obstacles:
  * Moving Obstacles: These obstacles move along the path, requiring the player to be cautious and avoid them.
  * Static Obstacles: These obstacles are stationary and the player must navigate around them.

### **Additional Features**
The project includes the following additional features:
* Camera Switching: The game allows switching between four different camera angles, providing the player with various perspectives to enhance their experience.
* Collision Handling: When the player's car collides with obstacles, the player is taken to a "dead scene," indicating the end of the game.
* Finish Line: When the player reaches the finish line, they are directed to a "win scene," signifying the successful completion of the game.
* Environment Design: Additional features and details have been added to the environment to enhance the overall aesthetics and atmosphere of the game, making it visually more appealing.
